            Transactional database workloads are executed in Row Stores. Typical are single tuple lookups, many modifications and simple predicate evaluation. On the other hand analytical database workloads are executed in Column Stores (Aggregation, Full Attribute Scans, Specialized Joins). With HYRISE it is possible to combine both workloads and to find the optimal storage strusture.

            Transactional database workloads are executed in Row Stores. Typical are single tuple lookups, many modifications and simple predicate evaluation. On the other hand analytical database workloads are executed in Column Stores (Aggregation, Full Attribute Scans, Specialized Joins). When combining both workloads, what is the optimal storage structure?

          </h4>
          <p>
            In static layout selection the layout is chosen before application deployment. For narrow tables, finding the optimal layout is easy and can be done through exhaustive enumeration. But enterprise applications can have super-wide schemas  with up to 300 attributes, this would result in billions of possible layouts. However, application workload on the database might change. So workload change may require adaptation.
